Gibson Index
============

[The Gibson Index](http://www.gibsonindex.org) is a ranking system for the relative severity of Cyber Attacks.

Media reports and political discussions surrounding computer security lack a simple structured context for communicating this information. This can result in simple concepts becoming muddled and intimidating.

The Gibson Index ranges from 0 to 7, with 7 being the most severe class of attack (resulting in multiple intentional deaths and/or egregious financial/economic damage).

Quick Summary
-------------

Please read the full rules at http://www.gibsonindex.org/overview, or here on GitHub at https://github.com/beryllium/Gibson-Index/blob/master/Overview.md

### Events

**Gibson Level Zero:** A level zero event is one that causes little or no disruption/damage, or is the result of a mitigating circumstance.

**Gibson Level One:** A level one event is one that has some small real-world consequences, but can often have non-malicious explanations. 

### Attacks

**Gibson Level Two:** Level Two attacks have a clear malicious intent and can result in longer outages, more significant privacy issues, and generally more damage than Level One events.

**Gibson Level Three:** Minor financial damages and moderate privacy implications, generally stemming from a partial penetration of systems. 

**Gibson Level Four:** Major financial damages or privacy implications. Well-defended systems breached by vulnerability. 

**Gibson Level Five:** Systematic, coordinated, broad penetration of a multitude of networks, likely perpetrated by a large team or nation-state.  

**Gibson Level Six:** Level Six threats remain mostly theoretical. They consist of attacks that manifest themselves in real-world, targetted, intentional damage. 

**Gibson Level Seven:** A Level Seven attack (also mostly theoretical) would result in mass casualties from intentional, targeted efforts. 

Inspiration and Call to Action

This document is just a basic overview, an early draft. It needs improvement through better examples and a refinement of the categories.

The inspiration for this document is the desire to counteract perceived persecution and vilification of people who have done little or nothing wrong - they are being elevated to the level of Hacker-Pariahs, but they have done nothing to warrant such persecution. The firestorms surrounding [Aaron Swartz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#Investigations_and_prosecution), [Ahmed Al-Khabaz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_College#Student_Records_Security_Controversy), and [Andrew "weev" Auernheimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weev) are just a few examples of disproportionate responses to Gibson Level Zero or Level One events.

We need a guide to what constitutes a clear and present danger - [this is that guide](http://www.gibsonindex.org).
